# modvporter
a set of data to port mods from one version of mc to another.

First data set will be for 1.12.2 to 1.20.1.

Later, one for 1.20.1 to latest release will be made.

from then on, more data conversion sets will be created. However, mods will be converted more and more times.
Note: an automatic update loader will be coded eventually.



This is for all those people who want to play with 1.12 mods on the latest version with other mods from different versions. ViaVersion is good for letting newer clients join older servers, but it's not good enough for me.
